<p><span class="weinre">weinre</span> is shipped as archives
available at Apache.

<p>To install weinre, download a <tt>bin</tt> release, unarchive
to wherever you'd wish.  <span class="weinre">weinre</span> is not
sensitive to the directory it's installed in, and does not 
write to any files.

<h2>Releases</h2>

<p>The distribution releases should be available at:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/cordova">http://apache.org/dist/incubator/cordova/</a>
(at the time of this writing, that link does not actually resolve because
there are no official releases)
</ul>

<p>The archive releases should be available at:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/cordova/">http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/cordova/</a>
(at the time of this writing, that link does not actually resolve because
there are no official releases)
</ul>

<p>Unofficial builds are available here:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/">http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/</a>
</ul>

<p>The archives available are:

<ul>
<li><tt>apache-cordova-weinre-{version}-bin.tar.gz</tt>
<li><tt>apache-cordova-weinre-{version}-bin.zip</tt>
<li><tt>apache-cordova-weinre-{version}-doc.tar.gz</tt>
<li><tt>apache-cordova-weinre-{version}-doc.zip</tt>
<li><tt>apache-cordova-weinre-{version}-src.tar.gz</tt>
<li><tt>apache-cordova-weinre-{version}-src.zip</tt>
</ul>

<p>The difference between the <tt>.tar.gz</tt> and <tt>.zip</tt>
archives is the archive format only.  When expanded, both archives
produce the same files.

<p>The <tt>doc</tt> archives contain the stand-alone HTML documentation
<p>The <tt>src</tt> archives contain the ready-to-rebuild source
<p>The <tt>bin</tt> archives contain the ready-to-run binaries

<p>If the <tt>{version}</tt> contains a moniker like <tt>pre</tt>, this
is indicative of a non-final release.
